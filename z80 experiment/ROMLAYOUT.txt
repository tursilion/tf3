Like the TI version, most of this 512k cart is empty space.

There is more than 128k of data, so 256k is the smallest possible
size. But the TI cart cheats and dedicates an entire page to single
elements. The Coleco pages are 16k instead of 8k, so for now, just
to get it up and running I'm doing the same and that means doubling
again to 512k. At least it'll zip up nicely. ;)

Also leaving the first 2 pages unused means it should work fine on
the Phoenix, which has only 512k - 32k (for the SGM RAM) available.

Since the raw data headers are expected at the start of the page,
I'm not using my usual banking packer for this, and doing it by
hand instead.
