This is a tribute to the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive game Thunder Force III.

This is just a music player with a few reproduced screens from Thunder Force III. Don't get too excited, I don't plan to make the whole game. (Maybe in 20 years).

I've loved Thunder Force III since I first saw it in the late 80s and have always wanted to do something with it on the TI. Adding Genesis support to my vgmcomp2 toolset was primarily motivated by being able to do this, and here it is!

Machine translation will never beat a chip-tune artist's manual efforts, nor a pixel artist for that matter. But lacking those skills, and not knowing anyone I can just say "hey, go off and reproduce the entire Thunder Force III soundtrack for the SN76489, will ya?" to, I went with my skills, which is machine conversion.

Most of the tunes came out pretty good! I'm most pleased with Ellis and Metal Squad (yeah, I know that's TF4). Haides and Stand Up Against Myself are probably the weakest, and I think I know why, but... this was supposed to take a weekend and it has been nearly two weeks - it's time to move on. :)

The final result is a 256KB non-inverted cartridge image that should work on both hardware and most emulation... it doesn't do anything fancy.
